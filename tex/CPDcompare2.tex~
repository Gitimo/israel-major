\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this manual is to outline the measurements I did to compare the three Kelvin Probes (\kp{}s) in 618, 301 and 101. The one in 618 measures in ambient, 301 in the glove box ($\rightarrow$ nitrogen atmosphere) and the one inside the Lakeshore in 101 (referred to as the \lq{}\McA{}\rq{} ) can measure in ambient, argon atmosphere \& in vacuum with temperature dependence. Next to measuring the contact potential difference (\cpd{}), all three \kp{}s can be used surface potential voltage (\spv{}) by illuminating the sample.\\
A standard reference with known and stable work-function, \hopg{}, is used to calibrate the probe, \ie{} to find the work function of the probehead. To compare the three probes, I used \sih{} as a relatively stable and well understood sample.
\subsection{(Brief-)Theory}

\section{Procedure}
A fresh \hopg{}-surface is prepared by rubbing adhesive tape onto a piece and tearing it off evenly. The piece is mounted onto a sample-holder and the \cpd{} is measured.\\
n-\sih{} (100) with different resitivities/doping-levels is prepared according to a slightly modified standard cleaning procedure. Pieces of suitable size are cut, swiped off with ethyl-acetate and successively sonicated for six minutes each in ethyl-acetate, acetone, methanol and water. The pieces are ashered at 100W with 1\litmin O$_2$ and 1.5\litmin Ar for 3 minutes, rinsed with water, etched in 2\% HF, rinsed with water and ashered again as before. The pieces are etched as before, back-contacts are created by applying InGa-eutectic to a scratched back surface. The piece is mounted onto a sample holder and the \cpd{} is measured for at least two minutes each on three different spots per piece. The time the sample is subjected to ambient after the last etch is recorded and used in a linear fit \lq{}$\Delta (\cpd{})/\Delta \, t$\rq{} to find the -- arguably somewhat hypothetical -- \cpd{} each spot on each piece had right after the etch.\\
p-\sih{}<100> is prepared as n-\sih{}, but the 2\% HF-etch is replaced by a three minutes etch in 5\% buffered-oxide-etch (BOE), a solution of 10:1 NH$_4$F/HF.\\
Alumina-passivated silicon was used as obtained from Nir, aluminium coated silicon was used as obtained from Igal.

\section{Results \& Discussion}
\subsection{Callibration with \hopg{} and general remarks}
\paragraph{General}
The noise peak-to-peak ratio is typically on the order of 10mV, good measurements can be obtained with a signal peak-peak-distance of three times that value. For \hopg{} and \sih distances of as high as 90-120 mV can be reached.\\
The work function of freshly cleaved \hopg{} changes with -0.9 to -1.2 mV per minute. The difference in measured \cpd{} between successively cleaved \hopg{} surfaces is of the order of $\sim$10 mV. The difference of the work function of the probe-head on different dates can be greater~\footnote{Someone else -- or I, for that matter -- measured a \cpd{} and touched their sample with the probe...}, up to 100 mV. With good noise-reduction~\footnote{If necessary, turn off lights and air-conditioning in the room} the machine noise level can be brought down to $\pm$10 mV.
\paragraph{\McA{}}
A jump of 20-40 mV can be observed when switching on the weak pump and a similar jump of $\sim$10 mV is often observed when switching on the turbo pump. These jumps are inconsistent in size and direction and can thus best be interpreted as a displacement of the probehead over the sample. The \cpd{} of \hopg{} in the \McA is independent of temperature to within 10 mV, measured over the range of 50K to 300K, in steps of 50K, in both directions.

\end{figure}
\paragraph{glove box}
The difference in \cpd{} between \hopg{} cleaved inside the glove box and \hopg{} cleaved outside and brought into the box is 60 $\pm$ 30 mV. The work function of \hopg{} when cleaved outside is lower than when cleaved inside, consistent with the observed degradation of \hopg{} in ambient, \ie{} its decrease in \wf{}. Thus, for calibration, \hopg{} has a \wf{} of 4.65 $\pm$ 0.01 eV when cleaved in an inert atmosphere and 4.59 $\pm$ 60 eV when cleaved in air.\\

\subsection{Comparison}
\paragraph{n-\sih{}}
The standard deviation of measured \cpd{} between spots of the same piece is comparable to that between pieces, so all obtained values were averaged. The values obtained across the three systems agree very well with each other and in the case of mid- and high-resistivity silicon also with theory, see Figure \ref{fig:nsih}. A three,  instead of only one, minute long HF etch did not influence the \cpd{} obtained for the low resistivity sample. Here, frankly, the wafers were old and the box might have been mislabelled. Another explanation for the deviation from theory might be that the method fails because the surface-reactivity of silicon increases with doping-level. Thus for highly-doped silicon, the linear extrapolation could be more \lq{}hypothetical\rq{} than for the other two conditions.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{p-\sih{}}
\paragraph{Alumina and aluminium coated silicon}
The \wf{} of alumina passivated silicone was found to be 4.41 eV in 618 and 4.37 eV in the \McA{}. \spv{} was 540 $\pm$ 10 mV in 618 and 520 $\pm$ 10 mV in the \McA using the same illumination set-up. Using an LED, the bend bending was observed to be as high as 600 mV. We assume that our Halogen-lamp set-up doesn't always saturate the sample and that heat-effects come into play. This will be investigated further.\\
The work function of  (hydrophillic) aluminium coated silicon was 4.0 $\pm$ 0.1 eV in 618 and 4.17$\pm$ X eV in the \McA{}. Apart from the mentioned \lq{}jump\rq{}, the \cpd{} did not change when the sample was cooled to 250 K, confer Table XXX. Apparently, no ice forms on the surface. This stroke of luck might be because the sample is not the coolest point in the \McA{}.

\section{Conclusion}
\sih{} is a good system to check and compare Kelvin Probes. It is easily prepared and we have great practical knowledge about it.\\
The three \kp{}s in use agree with each other and (mostly) with theory as well. Reliable measurements can be done with each individual probe. If absolute values, \ie{} work functions, are needed, special care has to be taken to calibrate. I advise to calibrate once before measuring and once after, to check if the probe-head has changed during measurement. Temperature dependent \spv{} will soon be a reality, the effect of warmth on \spv{} has to be investigated further.
